<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="aboutus">
<p>
    Here at Washed Up Car Wash, We are a family-owned business that aims to give you the best car wash experience you can have. Our express tunnel takes about 2 minutes from start to end, with getting in being as simple as putting your vehicle in neutral. <br><br>
Our wash packages offer a variety of soaps such as Wax, Ceramic Coating, and an underbody wash and protectant for your vehicle. With every wash there is a lubrication cycle that happens, so you can rest assured that your vehicle is in safe hands!<br><br>
 We have wash packages starting at $8 up to $20. With every wash, you can expect a variety of free amenities, such as interior cleaning wipes, vacuums, and floor mat cleaners. If you ever need help, we also offer some of the best customer service in Boulder County!<br><br>
We also offer three unlimited wash club packages starting at $15 a month, ranging to $22 and $29 a month. With this package, you can come through as many times as you want in a month. With two washes per month, the membership pays for itself!
Feel free to stop by our location on 1876 Hover St., Longmont CO and get Washed Up!
